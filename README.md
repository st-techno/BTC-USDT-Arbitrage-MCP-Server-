# BTC-USDT Arbitrage (MCP Server)

# How it works:

All secure credentials and hostnames are read via environment variables.

All AI agent and arbitrage logic is exposed as MCP tools, enforcing Cerbos-powered dynamic risk governance and access control checks.

All memory is persistent and vector-searchable in Redis with high-performance ANN settings.

All trading and backtesting flows feature robust institutional logging and error handling.

The server runs as ASGI via Uvicorn and can be dockerized or cloud-deployed for production.

Keep:

Your Cerbos policies, Redis connection secrets, and exchange API keys should be managed securely in cloud/devops workflows.

Usage:

Run this script to start the MCP server.

Integrate and extend the tools as needed for institutional arbitrage, governance, and compliance workflows.
